### Documentation
Javadoc for this project is available [here](https://oscarqjh.github.io/NTU_SC2002_FYPMS/).

### Environment Set up

This project is developed with [Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 20+36-2344)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and tested on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

**To run the application:**   
First, clone the repository into local device from github and ensure that directory is properly set up:
```
├── src   
|   ├── Data copy  
|   ├── main
|   |   ├── Data
|   |   ├── Models
|   |   ├── Pages
|   |   ├── Utils
``` 
Next, compile all files in terminal:
```
javac -cp . main\Pages\*.java
javac -cp . main\Models\*.java
javac -cp . main\Utils\*.java
javac -cp . main\*.java
```  
Finally, run `MainApp`:
```
java main/MainApp
```
*Default password for any user is set to `password`*   
Note: `Data copy` contains a fresh copy of the csv data files used in our app. You can easily factory reset the application by discarding the csv files in main/Data file and replace them with a copy of the csv files in `Data copy`.

### Section 1: Introduction
The main objective was to design the Final Year Project Management System (FYPMS), where students can register and deregister projects as well as send requests to supervisors/coordinators for approval. The overall design is based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, namely encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism which is used in our menus for the entire application. Another guiding element for the design is the usage of SOLID design principles. The SOLID design principles are composed of single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle.

### Section 2: Design Principles
Throughout this project we used SOLID principle extensively as a guideline for our designing process of the application[1].   

#### 2.1 Single-responsibility principle (SRP)  
Each type of class is catered to its role. There are three types of classes, and each type of class has a single responsibility. Our system is designed such that the classes are catered to do only one job. For instance, the registering of FYP projects is separated into multiple Pages i.e the coordinator facing pages(CoordAllProject, CoordEditTitle, CoordMyPRoject, etc.). Utils i.e. the logic and data handling (Authenticator, FileHandler, ReqType3, etc.) and Models i.e. data structures that are manipulated (Student, Supervisor, Coordinator, Request, etc.) instead of a single class to handle the entire process. This not only facilitates code readability, but also allows for ease of modification to our system should there be changes to a specific part of the system.    

#### 2.2 Open-closed principle   
OCP is upheld as we can make extensions to the module without modifying the source code. Request is the abstract parent class of all its child concrete classes, the other sub-classes that extend it. Thus, new requests can be added by extending the Request class without modifying the Request source code. Because we have a closed abstract class, and it's open for extension, we could extend the request class and add on more features without changing the source code of the parent class. New features added thus would not lead to a breakage in code.

#### 2.3 Liskov's Substitution principle   
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. Such can be demonstrated by the classes User and Student. Our Login which uses the base class User still continues to function properly even if a derivation of User such as Student or Supervisor is passed into it. This is because subclasses of the User class provide no less functionalities than their base class, and the subclasses do not expect more than their base class.

#### 2.4 Interface Segregation principle   
The interface segregation principle states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. We use multiple Interfaces eg. InitialiseRequest and InitialiseProject extend from the main Models, but we do not segregate the interface because they belong to different categories. For example, the supervisor class implements both IinitializeRequest and InitialiseProject.    

#### 2.5 Dependency Injection principle   
The dependency injection principle states that a high level module should not depend upon low level modules, where both should depend on abstractions. In our Request class, it contains an abstract method “printInfo()” and “processRequest()”.  This acts as the abstraction layer which is implemented differently by the lower level modules (subclasses of Request) to print its own functionalities to be seen by the user, this abstraction allows for loose-coupling, low dependency of code. Ergo, if there were to be a change of code, other files would not need to be modified.

### Section 3: Features   

In addition to the above, the following new features were also added:

#### 3.1 Hidden Console Password Input   
In order to ensure secure password entry, we have implemented a hidden console password input feature. This feature hides the password being typed by the user, thereby providing a safer method for entering passwords.

#### 3.2 Password Encryption   
Users’ passwords are hashed with an encryption[2] algorithm ([PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)). This ensures the password to be secured even in the event that source file is leaked.

#### 3.3 Sorting Functionality   
Our system includes the capability to sort projects and requests based on specific features such as status, student name, ID, and more. This feature enhances user convenience and enables users to arrange students/projects in a manner that suits their preferences.

#### 3.4 Unique ID Generation
To ensure unique identification of projects and requests, we generate date time-based IDs using a UID Generator. To minimize the possibility of duplicate IDs being produced when two users generate an ID simultaneously, the UID Generator can generate up to 65536 unique IDs within the same millisecond.

### Section 3: Post Development Reflection
During the project development process, we encountered several challenges. These included issues with the object-oriented programming (OOP) design, implementing the request class due to complexities surrounding accountability and request execution, avoiding tight coupling between classes, and creating UML class diagrams that were appropriately designed. To overcome these challenges, we performed a thorough analysis of the object relationships and applied SOLID principles to better manage class structure. We also followed design principles when creating the UML class diagrams and performed debugging and revision to refine the application's functionality.

In particular, we faced challenges when implementing the different request types as separate util classes. This approach proved to be too complex and inefficient. As a solution, we decided to implement the request class as an abstract class, which can be inherited by various child request classes. We added an abstract processRequest() method to the Request class, which the child request classes can implement. This approach allows for easier addition of more request types to the application in the future.
